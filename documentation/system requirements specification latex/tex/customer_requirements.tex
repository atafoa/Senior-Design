Some of our customer requirements are the product has to open and close, to be easy to set up, battery powered, ready for large scale production, Bluetooth/WiFi controlled, and be \$20 or less. Other products that are available on the market do meet some of these requirements but all those products are not around \$20. Our focus is being around \$20 while in low level production, this way when we scale up it will lower cost due to buying parts in bulk. Another one of the requirements is the product being easy to set up. This means the customer set up experience should last around 5 to 10 minutes. The customer should be able to remotely control the shutters from almost anywhere in the building, basements may not work.
