Other requirements include there being apps for both android and ios and the code being modular so each section can act independently and be changed without having to change the entirety of the code base.

\subsection{Android App}
\subsubsection{Description}
Blink shutters mobile application that lets users interact with their smart shutter appliance. Includes setting a schedule for when the shutters will open and how much light will they let in, it will also display the each shutters battery percentage and the current position the shutters are in.

\subsection{Modular Code }
\subsubsection{Description}
Each section of the program must be completely independent of each other. Meaning if we change the embedded code for the shutters this should not affect how we send information to the app through the middle where. This will also help in locating bugs and should lead to them being fixed quicker.
