The Smart Shutter is a system that performs the single task of opening and closing shutters either from user input or from a schedule. The intended user audience is eventually everyone but for now it is nursing homes or assisted living. They will be able to interact with the shutters through an app available on either ios or android. On the app users can set a schedule for when the shutters can open or close, and users can open or close the shutters.  

\subsection{Purpose and Use}
We expect our product to be used everyday either following an adjustable schedule or from user input. The shutter should 100\% adjustable meaning if the user only wants the shutters open 10\% or 17\% they can do that. Also if the user decides to adjust the position the app will update and show that new position.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
Currently our intended users are people who live in assisted care, we do plan on going public with the product and it being available in retail stores. This product is designed for all customers not limited to assisted care.
