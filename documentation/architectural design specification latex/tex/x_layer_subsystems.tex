The mobile application layer has four subsystems, there is a subsystem for scheduling which allows the mobile app to create a set schedule for automation of the change of shutter positions. This allows a user to set a predefined time they want to change the shutters position and the shutters would automatically change positions without interaction from the mobile app. There is also a subsystem that defines how the shutters and the mobile app will communicate with each other

\subsection{Mobile Device Communications}
Mobile devices use the mobile application to send request to the hub.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Users have an android or ios phone and users have not tampered with the application. 

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
Properly taking commands from the user and displaying all the option for the user as well as displaying the status of each shutter that is connected to the hub.
