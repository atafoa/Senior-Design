The mobile application layer has four subsystems, there is a subsystem for scheduling which allows the mobile app to create a set schedule for automation of the change of shutter positions. This allows a user to set a predefined time they want to change the shutters position and the shutters would automatically change positions without interaction from the mobile app. There is also a subsystem that defines how the shutters and the mobile app will communicate with each other

\subsection{Mobile Device Communications}
Mobile devices use the mobile application to send request to the hub.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Any assumptions made in the definition of the subsystem should be listed and described. Pay particular attention to assumptions concerning interfaces and interactions with other layers.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
Each of the responsibilities/features/functions/services of the subsystem as identified in the architectural summary must be expanded to more detailed responsibilities. These responsibilities form the basis for the identification of the finer-grained responsibilities of the layer's internal subsystems. Clearly describe what each subsystem does.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Interfaces}
Each of the inputs and outputs for the subsystem are defined here. Create a table with an entry for each labelled interface that connects to this subsystem. For each entry, describe any incoming and outgoing data elements will pass through this interface.

    \begin{tabular}{ | p{1cm} | p{6cm} | p{3cm} | p{3cm} |}
    \hline
    ID & Description & Inputs & Outputs \\ \hline
    \#xx & Description of the interface/bus & \pbox{3cm}{input 1 \\ input 2} & \pbox{3cm}{output 1}  \\ \hline
    \#xx & Description of the interface/bus & \pbox{3cm}{N/A} & \pbox{3cm}{output 1}  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Subsystem 2}
Repeat for each subsystem

\subsection{Subsystem 3}
