The application layer will take user inputs and send that input to the hub or the shutters directly depending on the connection type. The application layer is also able to request data from the shutters as well such as the current position and battery level

\subsection{Layer X Description}
Each layer should be described separately in detail. Descriptions should include the features, functions, critical interfaces and interactions of the layer. The description should clearly define the services that the layer provides. Also include any conventions that your team will use in describing the structure: naming conventions for layers, subsystems, modules, and data flows; interface specifications; how layers and subsystems are defined; etc. 

\subsection{Layer Y Description}
Each layer should be described separately in detail. Descriptions should include the features, functions, critical interfaces and interactions of the layer. The description should clearly define the services that the layer provides. Also include any conventions that your team will use in describing the structure: naming conventions for layers, subsystems, modules, and data flows; interface specifications; how layers and subsystems are defined; etc. 

\subsection{Layer Z Description}
