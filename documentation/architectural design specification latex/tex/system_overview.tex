The overall structure of our system, includes three systems. Those systems are the application layer, the hub layer, and the shutter layer. The application will interact with the shutters by either using the hub to control the shutters or by directly connecting to the shutters over bluetooth and controlling the shutters from there.

\subsection{Layer X Description}
Each layer should be described separately in detail. Descriptions should include the features, functions, critical interfaces and interactions of the layer. The description should clearly define the services that the layer provides. Also include any conventions that your team will use in describing the structure: naming conventions for layers, subsystems, modules, and data flows; interface specifications; how layers and subsystems are defined; etc. 

\subsection{Layer Y Description}
Each layer should be described separately in detail. Descriptions should include the features, functions, critical interfaces and interactions of the layer. The description should clearly define the services that the layer provides. Also include any conventions that your team will use in describing the structure: naming conventions for layers, subsystems, modules, and data flows; interface specifications; how layers and subsystems are defined; etc. 

\subsection{Layer Z Description}
Each layer should be described separately in detail. Descriptions should include the features, functions, critical interfaces and interactions of the layer. The description should clearly define the services that the layer provides. Also include any conventions that your team will use in describing the structure: naming conventions for layers, subsystems, modules, and data flows; interface specifications; how layers and subsystems are defined; etc.
