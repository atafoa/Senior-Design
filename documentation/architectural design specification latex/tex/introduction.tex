The Smart Shutter is a system that is able to automatically open and close shutters on a schedule or upon a users request. The intended user audience is nursing homes or any other assisted living but eventually we want to expand our project to every home. Users will be able to interact with the shutters from their mobile device using the accompanying mobile app. On the app users can set a schedule for when they wan. Our key requirements include the products overall cost to be around \$20, should be able to controlled over WiFi, and the product should have set up time of 15 minutes.
