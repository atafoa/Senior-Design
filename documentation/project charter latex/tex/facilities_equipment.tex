Currently we do not know everything we need, but what we do need is a labspace to develop the hardware portion of the shutters.We plan on using the Electrical Engineering Laboratory to construct the hardware. We will need shutters, a motor, a motor controller, a microcontroller, bluetooth adapters, iPhone, Android phone, and a computer to program everything. We are also planning on 3d printing our gears, which change the positioning the shutters, therefore we will need access to 3d printers. We realise if we 3D print out gears this will keep the cost of production low, but gears may need to be replaced more often as opposed to having gears made out of more durable materials such as aluminium, copper, chrome, nickel, steel, iron, or any other metal. We will also need a Wifi network to test the communication of the shutters on both bluetooth and Wifi. We also plan on developing apps for both Android and IOS therefore we will need two phones that run each operating system. We plan on developing the majority of the project in the Electrical Engineering lab simply due to the fact that the Electrical Engineering team will develop the hardware in this particular lab. We will not outsource any of our work, we are confident in our abilities, we also plan on purchasing bluetooth adapters, motor controllers, motors, and microcontrollers from online, currently we are unaware from which website but right now we are looking for affordable vendors.
