The immediate stakeholders of our project are the customers, sponsors, and developers. Customers are the ones who rely on the developers to create a product that meets their needs.They also rely on the sponsor to set expectations for the product. The sponsor funds the development of the idea, also sets expectations for the development of the product. Our point of contact for the sponsor will be Alex Escobar for app development, Hunter Walters for hardware development, and Haris Qureshi for embedded development.The point of contact for the customers will be Jeff Groenteman our sponsor. On the embedded development team we have Atafo Abure working with the app development team as well as Haris Qureshi and we have David Nguyen, Deion Nwaefulu, Aditya Rajguru working with the hardware development. The people working with the app development team will help set up communication from the app to the hub and the group working with the hardware team will help set up communication from the hub to each shutter. We split the team this way due to Atafo and Haris being CSE and David, Deion, and Aditya being CpE, this way we play to our strengths. We plan on maintaining the product owner and scrum master throughout the entirety of the project unless a change is mandatory. We choose to maintain the same scrum master due to consistency, meaning instead of having to change our method of scrum every so often, we can instead take our time getting used one scrum master.
