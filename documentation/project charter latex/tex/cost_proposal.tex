We plan on making our product cost \$20, therefore we approximate our budget for \$40 to give ourselves some added leeway. The money will come from the \$800 budget we have from UTA. we expect the micro controller to be the most expensive item then the motor controller and motor. Currently these are our top expenses for the product.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
 Currently our only source of funding will be the \$800 from CSE department, we do not have any potential funding sources, we do not expect to go over budget. Our goal is to make an affordable and complete product that cost only \$20, we anticipate that our current budget should be more than enough.
