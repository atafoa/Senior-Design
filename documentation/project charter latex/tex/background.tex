The staff and patient time is valuable, currently staff has to spend that precious time on tasks such as opening and closing shutters, changing trash, cleaning floors, and more yet to be automated task. Our goal is to automate all of the tasks listed one day, but the journey of a thousand steps starts with the first, we’ll start with automating the shutters for today. We are aware our idea has been done before, but what we plan on doing differently than our predecessors is making an affordable smart shutter. Currently the motorized shutters go for \$30 and some \$17( for a limited time only) while our rendition will sell for only \$20, they will also connect to your phone through an app on iOS and android for 100\% control, and it can follow a user set schedule. Our sponsor Mr. Groenteman has noticed there are areas of optimization in nursing homes and assisted living. He also noticed the benefits of using smart devices on a day to day bases first hand. One of the smart devices he has is the nest smart thermometer this allows him to control his home’s heating and cooling from anywhere around the world, this helps him to save more money which in turn helps the environment. Frankly, it's hard to disagree with all the benefits of having a smarter home.
