The Smart Shutter is a system that is able to automatically open and close shutters on a schedule or upon a users request. The intended user audience is nursing homes or any other assisted living but eventually we want to expand our project to every home. Users will be able to interact with the shutters from their mobile device using the accompanying mobile app. On the app users can set a schedule for when they want. Our key requirements include the products overall cost to be around \$20, should be able to be controlled over WiFi, and the product should have set up time of 15 minutes.
The Smart Shutter is a system that performs the single task of opening and closing shutters either from user input or from a schedule. In order to accomplish this task, users will have to  interact with the shutters through an app available on either ios or android. On the app users can set a schedule for when the shutters can open or close, and users can open or close the shutters. We plan on having the mobile application communicate to either the shutter directly over bluetooth or through wifi using a hub. With the hub the mobile users can interact with their shutters from anywhere in the world.
