\subsection{Layer Hardware}
A mobile phone

\subsection{Layer Operating System}
Userâ€™s will need to have Android 10.0 and iOS 13


\subsection{Layer Software Dependencies}
React Native framework

\subsection{Scheduling}
When users want to set a schedule this sub-system will handle the task. The system will send a HTTP post request to the hub which set the schedule, handle the task, and notify users when the task is completed

\subsubsection{Subsystem Hardware}
Users should have either devices Android or iOS.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Operating System}
Android 10.0 or iOS 13 or later

\subsubsection{Subsystem Software Dependencies}
Users be connected to the shutter with Bluetooth or the hub via Wi-Fi and users have not tampered with the Application 

\subsubsection{Subsystem Programming Languages}
Node JS


\subsubsection{Subsystem Data Structures}
Data received by the hub will be in JSON format and request will be HTTP request. Name of the shutter along with the mac address will be stored in a dictionary with the name being the value and the mac address being the key.


\subsubsection{Subsystem Data Processing}
JSON formatting for from the http get request

\subsection{Communication layer}

\subsubsection{Subsystem Hardware}
Users have devices that are running Android 10.0 or iOS 13 or later

\subsubsection{Subsystem Operating System}
Android 10.0 or iOS 13 or later

\subsubsection{Subsystem Software Dependencies}
React native framework
The application must be able to send HTTP get or post request to the hub, also be able to communicate to the shutter through Bluetooth 

\subsubsection{Subsystem Programming Languages}
Node JS

\subsubsection{Subsystem Data Structures}
The application must send an HTTP request to the hub if users are connecting through WiFi 
If users are connected directly to the shutter they must send request through Bluetooth and receive acknowledgement packets

\subsubsection{Subsystem Data Processing}
Using simple HTTP request and bluetooth libraries to communicate
